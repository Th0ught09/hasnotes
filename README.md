# HasNotes

This is a haskell markdown parser that parses .md files to your terminal. The app is designed for users display their markown files in a terminal freindly output. 

# Requirements
As previously mentioned this app is serves as a markdown parser. I would recommend writing your .md files in your favourite text editor (vim for the win) and then using this app to see how the output will look on your computer.

This app is coded in haskell, and can be run with ```stack run```.

# App flow
- User creates/edits markdown note
